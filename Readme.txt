Grocery Tracker C++ Project
Overview
This C++ program, dubbed the "Grocery Tracker," is designed to help a grocery store analyze purchasing trends by tracking the frequency of each item purchased. The data is loaded from a text file, and the program provides several functionalities, including searching for a specific item's frequency, displaying all items' frequencies, and visually representing this data in a histogram.

Reflection
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The "Grocery Tracker" addresses the need for grocery stores to understand customer purchasing behaviors better. By analyzing which items are bought most frequently, stores can optimize inventory, layout, and promotions, ultimately enhancing profitability and customer satisfaction.
What did you do particularly well?

Exception handling was a strength in this project, ensuring the program can gracefully handle unexpected situations, like missing files. The code is also well-structured and adheres to best practices, enhancing readability and maintainability.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Future enhancements could include more complex data analytics, allowing for trend predictions or seasonal adjustments. Implementing a database system could also improve data security and integrity, and efficiency could be boosted through algorithm optimizations or by introducing multithreading for data processing.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Implementing the histogram functionality was challenging due to the need for precise string manipulation. Research, trial and error, and leveraging resources like Stack Overflow and C++ documentation were crucial to overcoming these hurdles.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills such as data manipulation, file I/O, user input validation, and OOP practices are highly transferable. Exception handling and the practice of writing clean, well-documented code are also invaluable skills for any programming project.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By using clear naming conventions, consistent code structure, and comprehensive comments, the program is easy to understand and maintain. The modular design—encapsulating functionalities within class methods—also makes the program adaptable for additional features or modifications.
